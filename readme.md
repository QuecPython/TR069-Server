# QuecPython-TR069-CWMP

[中文](./README_ZH.md) | English

## Overview

TR-069, fully known as "Technical Report 069," is an application layer protocol established by the Broadband Forum (originally DSL Forum). It is used for remote management and configuration of broadband devices for home and business users, such as home gateways, routers, and VoIP phones. The protocol is also known as the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP), enabling Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to automatically configure, monitor, and manage end-devices connected to the network from a central server.

The Quecpython version of **TR069** mainly integrates customizable **CWMP** and **RPC** features to meet customer needs. Customers only need to register the corresponding time to handle the respective **RPC** events to participate in the business interaction between **ACS** and **CPE**.
